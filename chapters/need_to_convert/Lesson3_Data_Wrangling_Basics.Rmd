```


## Outline

- Loading and inspecting data

- Working with vectors

- Working with matrices

- Working with dataframes (the old way)


## Basics of data formats {.smaller}

- Data are typically stored as text files

- Different 'rows' of data appear on different lines

- Values for a given 'row' are typically separated by either a comma, or a tab

 Comma-separated values (.csv)
 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
name,age,member_since
bob,20,2015
frank,40,2015
tammy,15,2016
```

Tab-separated values (.tsv or .txt)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
name  age  member_since
bob  20  2015
frank  40  2015
tammy  15  2016
```


## Loading data into R

| Data type               | Extension | Function          | Package            |
|:------------------------|:----------|:------------------|:-------------------|
| Comma separated values  | csv       | `read.csv()`      | utils (default)    |
|                         |           | `read_csv()`      | readr (tidyverse)  |
| Tab separated values    | tsv       | `read_tsv()`      | readr              |
| Other delimited formats | txt       | `read.table()`    | utils              |
|                         |           | `read_table()`    | readr              |
|                         |           | `read_delim()`    | readr              |
| Excel                   | xlsx, xls | `read_excel()`    | readxl (tidyverse) |


## Which read function should I use? (old)

- For reading data tables use:
  - `read_csv`/`read_tsv` from the `readr` package (`tidyverse`)
  
  - This avoids some very annoying default R behavior (changing names, making strings into factors)

- For reading matrices, use:
 
  - `read.csv`/`read.table` (baseR)
  
  - This allows you to use rownames, which are very useful for working with matrices
    
    
## Which read function should I use? (new)

- Always use `read_csv`/`read_tsv` from the `readr` package (`tidyverse`)
  
- For reading matrices, use the function `column_to_rownames` to specify which column should be treated as rownames 
 
  
## Specifying where a file 'is' {.smaller}

- Relative and absolute file 'paths'

```{r}
getwd()
```

- Organize project with a 'data' folder for data. 

- Use the `here` function to specify the file path.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
imported_data <- read_csv("/Users/jmmcfarl/BootCamp/R_BootCamp_2019/
                          data/data_file.csv")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
imported_data <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'data_file.csv')
```




## For example {.smaller}

Load a tab-delimited table of metadata

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_table <- read_tsv(here::here('data', 'my_metadata_table.tsv'))
```

Load the second sheet from an xlsx file

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_table <- read_excel(here::here('data', 'my_metadata_file.xlsx'), sheet = 2)
```

## Loading matrices {.smaller}

```{r}
counts_matrix <-  read_tsv(here::here('data', 'normalized_counts.txt'))
corner(counts_matrix)
```

```{r}
counts_matrix <- column_to_rownames(counts_matrix, var = 'X1')
corner(counts_matrix)
```



## Inspecting data {.smaller}

- Always start with some quick inspection of data after reading it into R

- Check for:

  - Column (always) and row (matrix only) names are correct
  
  - Make sure data types of columns are correct

- Dataframe:
  - `View(df)`: Open spreadsheet viewer
  - `head(df)`: Show top K (10) rows
  - `glimpse(df)`: quick overview of a table 

- Matrix:
  - `useful::corner(mat)`: Show upper left corner of matrix
  - `dim(mat)`: Number of rows and columns 
  - `rownames(mat)`/`colnames(mat)`: extract row/column names

**Practice**


## Backup plan

- Importing files using the RStudio `Import Dataset` tool.



## Accessing data? Let's start with a vector {.smaller}

```{r}
age <- c(15, 22, 45, 52, 73, 81)
```

<img src="../images/vector-index.png">

```{r}
age[5]
```

```{r}
idx <- c(3,5,6) # create vector of the elements of interest
age[idx]
```



## Selecting elements with logical statements {.smaller}

| Operator | Description |
| :-----------:|:-------------|
| > | greater than |
| >= | greater than or equal to|
| < | less than |
| <= | less than or equal to |
| == | equal to |
| != | not equal to |
| & | and |
| \| |or |

---

<img src="../images/vector-index.png">

```{r}
age > 50
```

```{r}
log_idx <- age > 50
age[log_idx]
#same as age[age > 50]
```

--- 

<img src="../images/vector-index.png">

```{r}
age == 52
```

```{r}
age[age == 52]
```

```{r}
age[age != 52]
```


## Subsetting using names {.smaller}

```{r}
age <- c(Allice = 15, Bob = 22, Charlie = 45, Dan = 52)
age
```

```{r}
names(age)
```


```{r}
age[c('Bob', 'Charlie')]
```

- Most useful when working with lists (more to come)


## Brief asside on NULL

R has another special value `NULL` which represents 'the absence of a value'. 

For example
```{r}
my_vec <- c(1,2,3)
names(my_vec)
```

Note: Subtly different from `NA`, but don't worry about that now.


## Reordering data

```{r}
x <- c(4, 2, 3, 5, 1)
sort(x)
```

- Or in decreasing order
```{r}
sort(x, decreasing = TRUE)
```


## Reordering using indexing

- Indexing can also be used to reorder data

```{r}
teaching_team <- c("Mary", "Meeta", "Radhika")
```

```{r}
reorder_teach <- teaching_team[c(3, 1, 2)] # Saving the results to a variable
reorder_teach
```


**Practice**



## Subsetting matrices

- Same as subsetting vectors, but can be applied to both rows and columns!

- General formula:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
matrix[row_set, column_set]
```

- `row_set` and `column_set` can be individual elements or vectors

- Leave either blank if you want all rows/columns, e.g.:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
matrix[row_set, ]
matrix[, column_set]
```

## Matrix subsetting examples

```{r}
counts_mat <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'counts_rpkm.csv'))
counts_mat <- column_to_rownames(counts_mat, var = 'X1')
useful::corner(counts_mat)
```

---

- 'Slice' out one row

```{r}
counts_mat[3, ]
```

---

- Or slice out a single column 

```{r}
counts_mat[, 3]
```

---

- Slice a set of rows and set of columns
```{r}
counts_mat[1:4, 2:3]
```

## Using rownames and column names 

- Use `colnames(mat)` and `rownames(mat)` to get the column and rownames of a matrix.

- Data for a list of rows (genes)

```{r}
counts_mat[c('ENSMUSG00000000028', 'ENSMUSG00000000037'), ]
```

--- 

- Specifying columns and rows by name
```{r}
counts_mat['ENSMUSG00000000001', c('sample7', 'sample5')]
```



## The %in% operator

- Check whether each element of vector1 is contained in the set vector2

```{r}
A <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)   
B <- c(3, 4, 5, 6)  

A %in% B
```


## Applications of %in% {.smaller}

- Useful for restricting to the intersection of elements in two lists
```{r}
A <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)   
B <- c(3, 4, 5, 6)  

A[A %in% B]
```

- Or checking whether any/all elements of A are contained in B

```{r}
any(A %in% B)
all(A %in% B)
```

## Other 'set' functions

- `intersect(A, B)`: return the elements in both `A` and `B`

- `setdiff(A, B)`: return the elements in `A` that are not in `B`

- `union(A, B)`: return the elements in either `A` or `B`



**Practice**


## Inspecting data visually

```{r, include = FALSE}
counts_mat <- read_csv(here::here('data', 'counts_rpkm.csv'))
counts_mat <- column_to_rownames(counts_mat, var = 'X1')
counts_mat <- as.matrix(counts_mat)
```

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height = 4}
x <- counts_mat['ENSMUSG00000081010',] 
hist(x)
```

--- 

```{r,  fig.width=5, fig.height = 4}
y <- counts_mat['ENSMUSG00000000037',]
plot(x,y)
```




## Subsetting lists {.smaller}

```{r}
people <- list(
  Allice = list(age = 20, height = 50, school = 'MIT'),
  Bob = list(age = 10, height = 30, school = 'Harvard'),
  Charlie = list(age = 40, height = 60, school = 'BU'),
  Frank = c(age = 10, height = 2)
  )
```

- To select a specific element from the list use 'double brackets'

```{r}
people[[2]]
```



## Subsetting lists {.smaller}

- With lists it's especially useful to access elements by name

```{r}
people[['Bob']]
```

- Another (equivalent) way is to use the `$` symbol. This is nice because it works with 'tab-complete'

```{r, eval = FALSE}
people$Bob
```

## Nested indexing of lists

- You can use multiple indices to pull out specific elements nested within a list

```{r}
people[['Allice']][['school']]
```

- Using `$` makes it much easier to read

```{r}
people$Allice$height
```

**Practice**



## Creating dataframes {.smaller}


```{r}
species <- c("ecoli", "human", "corn")
glengths <- c(4.6, 3000, 50000)
```

- Create a tibble (dataframe, table) using `tibble()` function. 

- Input as many columns as you want (must have same length)

```{r}
df <- tibble(species, glengths)
df
```

---

- Can name the columns

```{r}
df <- tibble(animal_species = species, genome_lengths = glengths)
df
```


## Quick note on new/old ways 

- `data.frame()` is the old way, gives a similar table

```{r}
df <- data.frame(species = species, glengths = glengths)
df
```

- But it makes strings into 'factors', and has some other subtle differences. 

- Use `tibble()`


## Subsetting dataframes (columns)

```{r, include = FALSE}
df <- tibble(species, glengths)
```

- You can access a column from a dataframe as if it were a list of vectors (it is):

```{r}
df$species
df[['species']]
```

## Subsetting dataframes (rows)

- You can access rows and columns of dataframes like matrix indexing

```{r}
df[2,]
```

```{r}
df[2:3, 'glengths']
```


## Saving data to a file

- Just like the inverse of reading data

- `write_csv` to save tables

- `write.csv` to save matrices

- Use `here` function to specify the path to save the file

```{r}
write_csv(df, here::here('results', 'my_dataframe.csv'))
```
