</center>

- Free

- Great for data analysis and visualization

- LOTS of bioinformatics/stats tools available

Downsides?

- It's a hodge-podge

---
## Course goals

- Convince you that R is an accessible and useful tool for you in your research

- Get over initial learning curve

- Prepare you to tackle computational projects next week

---
## Strategy of the course

- Emphasis on practical skills (data wrangling, visualization)

- Flagging areas with technical depth but giving the â€˜need-to-know'

- Slides, follow-along workbooks, and emphasis on hands-on practice

---
## I need your help

- I'm winging it (surprise!)

- I'll try to adapt as we go

- PLEASE give me feedback, ask questions!
